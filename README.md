# Tone-generator
This repository will help you to generate your desired musical tone. I have generated the musical tone for our beloved National Anthem.

## Pre-requisites:
1. Install tones library. (ignore, if already installed)
2. If you want to create your own tone, make sure that you have the musical notes for the same(along with the duration).

## Where to alter the code?
1. Open the .py file.
1. Store the musical notes of your tone in the list named 'res'.
2. Alter the speed variable if you want to speed up.
3. Take care of duration parameter in add_note() method.
4. If "done" message prints on your respective terminal, then kudos.

Happy musical coding!
